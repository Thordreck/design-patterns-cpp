# Mediator
The mediator design pattern consists on creating a central entity that acts as a bridge between several
components. These components are then able to communicate between them, without being even aware
of each other existence. The typical example of this is a chat room. Clients can send messages to each other
through the room itself. However, individual clients do not hold references to each other connected user.
