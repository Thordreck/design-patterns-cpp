# Functional Decorator
The functional decorator pattern has the same objective as the vanilla decorator design - that is, to
add functionality to an already-existing entity. This time, however, the functionality is added
to an existing function instead of a class or struct. The sample code included in this subproject
showcases how to wrap functions with or without return values and arguments by using variadic
template arguments.
