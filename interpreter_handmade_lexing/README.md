# Interpreter: Handmade Lexing
An interpreter is an entity that takes input text, process it and converts it to programming structures.
Take for example the interpreter of any interpreted language. It reads the raw text containing the programming
statements and converts it to actual machine code that can be executed.
Interpreters usually follow a two-step process. The steps are:
* Lexing: consists on splitting the input text into well-known tokens.
* Parsing: to convert the splitted tokens into structures.
This example shows how to write a simple handmade lexing mechanism for mathematical expressions.
