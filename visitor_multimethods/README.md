# Multimethods
Multimethods refer to the situation when we want to dispatch on runtime over more than one object type
using the same function. This subproject includes the typical example used in literature to show this
particular problematic - the collision between two objects. We would like to dispatch to the correct
function depending on what two objects are colliding.
